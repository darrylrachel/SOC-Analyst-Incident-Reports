## 5. Analysis
- **What it is:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application to access, view, and potentially include local files on the web server's file system. This can be done by manipulating file paths within the application, often through user-supplied input like URL parameters or form data. Successful exploitation can lead to information disclosure, code execution, or even complete system compromise. 
- **Why it matters:** Attackers can use ".." sequences (or similar techniques) to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the intended directory.   
- **Evidence:**
		RAW LOG
			Request URL: hxxps://172.16.17[.]13/?file=../../../../etc/passwd
			User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
			Request Method: GET
			Device Action: Permitted
			HTTP Response Size:: 0
			HTTP Response Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)
- **Impact if exploited:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, or system logs.

## 6. Recommended Actions
- Thoroughly validate all user-supplied inputs to prevent directory traversal attempts.  
- Use a whitelist of allowed file paths or IDs, and reject any input that doesn't match.  
- Remove or encode potentially malicious characters from user input.  
- Run web applications with the least necessary privileges to minimize the potential impact of an attack.

**Final Verdict:** True Positive, attack not successful
